# MITx-Machine-Learning-Course

Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. 
Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.

As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from the experience for the purpose of prediction or control.

The course covers:

- Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;

- Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;

- On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.

The learning outcomes of this course include:

1. Understanding principles behind machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning

2. Implementing and analyzing models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models

3. Choosing suitable models for different applications

4. Implementing and organizing machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering

The learner will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python projects designed for different practical applications.
